Hi Copilot, I’m revamping the look of my existing web project for an online bookstore called SmollStore. I want you to apply the following design and styling guidelines throughout the entire project (components, pages, modals, buttons, etc.):\*\*

### 🎨 Color Palette (Use these consistently):

-   **Primary Colors:**
    -   Soft Navy: `#2C3E50` (for headers, text, and borders)
    -   Warm Cream: `#FAF3E0` (main background)
    -   Dusty Rose: `#E8AEB7` (primary buttons, highlights)
-   **Accent Colors:**
    -   Sage Green: `#A8C3A0` (secondary buttons, badges)
    -   Muted Gold: `#D4AF7F` (premium elements, hover accents)
-   **Text/Utility:**
    -   Rich Charcoal: `#333333` (body text)
    -   Cool Gray: `#BDC3C7` (subtle borders, muted text)

### 🧩 General Styling:

-   Apply **modern minimalist** design principles: generous white space, clean UI, large readable fonts, soft shadows, and subtle animations.
-   Use **rounded corners** (e.g., `border-radius: 12px`) on cards, buttons, modals.
-   Use a **modern web font** like `Inter`, `Poppins`, or `DM Sans`.

### 🖱️ Hover/Interaction:

-   Add elegant **hover styles** for all buttons, cards, and links (e.g., scale slightly or soft shadow on hover).
-   Use **transitions** (200–300ms ease-in-out) for smoother interactions.

### 📦 Buttons:

-   Primary buttons: Dusty Rose background, white text, rounded, hover with Muted Gold glow or shade.
-   Secondary buttons: Sage Green background, navy text, hover with darker Sage or slight shadow.

### 📄 Forms:

-   Inputs with soft navy borders, focus outline in Dusty Rose or Muted Gold.
-   Labels in charcoal, subtle placeholder text in cool gray.

### 💬 Modals:

-   Centered with Warm Cream background, soft drop shadow.
-   Rounded corners, clear close icon, and header in Soft Navy.
-   Animate modals using fade/scale-in on open.

### 🔍 Cards & Book Previews:

-   Light background (`#FAF3E0`), soft shadows, padding, rounded corners.
-   Titles in Soft Navy, price tags in Muted Gold or Dusty Rose.

### 💡 Extras:

-   Use CSS variables to define this color palette globally.
    🧠 You can now analyze my project files and update all necessary styles, refactor components if needed, and suggest new folder structures or UI improvements to make it feel like a real professional bookstore site with a beautiful and cohesive theme.
